name: CI - sfos4.2 branch on SDK for 4.3.0 (aarch64,armv7hl,i486)

  # For the available docker images, see https://github.com/CODeRUS/docker-sailfishos-platform-sdk
  # Binaries for 4.3.0 are known to run on the most recent SFOS release (5.0.0 as of April 2025),
  # but when this breaks a new CI workflow configuration file shall be created from this one for the
  # "oldest common denominator"-SDK known to generate binaries which run on the then current SailfishOS release.
